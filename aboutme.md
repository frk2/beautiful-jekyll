My name's Faraz Khan. I was born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan and moved to California in 2011. I was one of the cofounders of [Screenhero](http://www.screenhero.com) which was a ultra low latency screen sharing tool for mac and windows. An acquisition by Slack allowed us to bring you Calls inside Slack.

Last year I decided that I'm done with web/mobile apps and decided to jump into what ive wanted to do since I was a child: make robots! The fusion of computers with anything electro-mechanical fascinates me. I took udacity's self driving car nano-degree and by the end of it I knew that I was made for this stuff. 

I've realized that I can only build stuff thats instantly useful and solves a big enough painpoint for myself and others around me. This is why I need to take the pain of highway stopngo traffic away for good.
